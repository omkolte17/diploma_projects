			<h3>BMW M3 </h3>
			<p>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been derived from the corresponding generations of the BMW 3 Series. The initial model was available in a coupé body style. At times the M3 has also been available in saloon and convertible body styles. Due to the coupé and convertible models no longer being part of the 3 Series range from 2015. The M3 name remains in use solely for the saloon version.</p>

			<h3>BMW 320d Station Wagon </h3>
			<p>The 320d is a very different animal. It's a wagon, and at this point, you might think that's not a big deal since you can get a 328i xDrive Sports Wagon in the States as well. It's also a diesel which may or may not remind you of buses. Fair enough. But let me tell you in advance: For what it was designed to do, BMW's F30 320d Touring with the M Sports Pack is probably the best product out there and you should be excited you're getting it as the 328d later this year (plus urea injection to make it 50-state legal).</p>

			<h3>BMW X6 </h3>
			<p>Broad. Muscular. Dynamic. The BMW X6 combines the solid stance of an X model with the sportiness of a coupé. The commanding front contains striking air inlets that provide an indication of the power lurking behind them.The large, sporty-shaped double kidney grille underlines this athletic presence, with an added air of supremacy provided by the double headlights and the fog lights, which are positioned wide on the vehicle’s exterior. When viewed from the side, the sporty, coupé-like silhouette comes to prominence, optically framed by the premium chrome surrounds of the windows.
